# DeepMobLearning-BloodMagic-Continued
BloodMagic addon for Deep Mob Learning

This is the DeepMobLearning addon mod for BloodMagic.
This is a continuation of Xt9's mods to keep up with support and introduce some niffty and creative changes, and allow for more options, flexability, and creatvitiy.



Currently the major difference of this mod is that it is designed to work along my DML Continuation mod which has more tiers, more power options to the extreme limits. 

There is plenty of bugs, cleaning, and potentially re-coding to do in order to provide some of the changes I think this mod should have, so do expect future releases to come as needed.

At the current state of the mod, it is safe to use as long as you use it with my continuation mod. 
This mod's birth is highly encouraged and began it's big journey thanks to the motivation and request by [FerreiraAlex](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLnoV4BBPVsxVEPtY4_UhcA)
Thanks man for all the bug reports and big motivation to bring this to life!
